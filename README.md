# JadeStrap #

Bootstrap example templates in Jade. 

## Why? ##

I hate doing things twice. And more than twice annoys me even more.

Because of this, I wanted to mark up the example Bootstrap files in Jade once and for future sites I can just steal
these templates from here.

I decided to put them on GitHub because ... well, I like sharing. :)

## Templates ##

### Bootstrap v3.0.3 ###

Retrieved from here : https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/v3.0.3.zip (2014-01-22).

This project marks up the basic Bootstrap templates as well as all of the [example Bootstrap
templates](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples) too.

## Viewing these Templates Locally ##

It's easy:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chilts/jadestrap.git
$ cd jadestrap
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

Then browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your local machine.

## LICENSE ##

Server code is MIT. Templates in HTML and CSS are the same as Bootstrap. Templates in Jade are MIT.
